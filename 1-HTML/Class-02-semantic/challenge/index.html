                    I don't know if we should be alone together <br>
                    I still got a crush, that's obvious <br>
                    If nobody's around, what's stopping us? <br>
                    Everywhere I go you show, whatever <br>
                    I don't ever mind sharing oxygen <br>
                    I just wanna get lost in your lungs <br>

                    Just a baby, but she's growing up so fast <br>
                    And I'm allergic to the waiting <br>
                    She's just a baby girl <br>
                    And I love to watch her dance <br>
                    But it's making me go crazy <br>

                    I don't think that we should be around each other <br>
                    When you're in the room, you get my eyes <br>
                    You open your mouth, I'm hypnotized <br>
                    I can make you laugh until you cry <br>
                    You know you got all my attention <br>
                    You know you got all mine <br>

                    Baby, I can't help but call her that <br>
                    Even though I shouldn't say it <br>
                    She was my baby girl <br>
                    I might never get her back <br>
                    But I don't mind being patient, yeah <br>
